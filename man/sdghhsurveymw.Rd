\description{
This dataset comprises household-level survey data collected across Malawi between 2018 and 2023 as part of a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring initiative.
The data captures detailed information on household water access, sanitation facilities, hygiene practices, and environmental conditions.
It includes geolocation data (latitude, longitude, altitude), survey timestamps, and various indicators such as the availability of handwashing facilities, type of toilet
used, and waste treatment methods. This dataset is instrumental for assessing progress in WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) outcomes and guiding evidence-based
interventions in underserved communities.
